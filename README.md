# DevOpsNodeApp


### DevOpsNodeApp is a project where I implemented DevOps practices to automate the deployment of a Node.js web application using GitHub Actions and Docker. Key highlights include:

Technology Stack: Utilized Node.js and Express for building the web application, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.

Continuous Integration (CI): Integrated GitHub Actions to automatically trigger builds and run tests on code changes pushed to the master branch, ensuring code quality and reliability.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Automated the deployment process with GitHub Actions, deploying the application into a Docker container. This ensured consistent deployments and faster release cycles.

Docker Containerization: Containerized the application using Docker, ensuring portability and consistency across different environments.

DevOps Principles: Demonstrated proficiency in DevOps methodologies by implementing automation, improving deployment efficiency, and reducing manual errors.

Outcome: Successfully deployed a scalable and maintainable Node.js web application, showcasing proficiency in modern DevOps tools and practices.

This project exemplifies my ability to leverage DevOps principles to streamline development workflows, automate deployments, and ensure the reliability and scalability of web applications.
